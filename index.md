## Seminar in Applied Microeconomics - Virtual Assembly and Discussion 

SAMVAAD is a platform for faculty and researchers in India to present their work and get feedback from the applied micro community. The online seminars will be conducted on Zoom every Friday from 10 AM to 11:15 AM.

- _Format:_ Speakers will have 45 mins to present their research, followed by 30 mins of Q&A. While the speaker is presenting, only clarifying questions may be asked in the chat window. Co-authors should feel free to answer questions in the chat and if a question is unanswered (or if there is no co-author), the moderator will interject the presenter to ask the question. After the presentation is over, the floor will be open for Q&A. Participants are requested to use the ‘raise hand’ feature on Zoom to queue up for comments.

- _Registration:_ Attendance is capped at 300 so please only [sign up](https://forms.gle/JsXhRoNskxuKQuk59) only if you can attend regularly. Space constraints and lack of an allocation mechanism unfortunately imply that preference will be given to faculty over grad students. 

- _Invites:_ The link to the webinar will be shared with registered participants 2 hours before the talk. To prevent ‘zoombombing’, please do not share the invitation link or post it online.

- _Scheduling:_ If you would like to present your research, please [sign up here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HdFa97ikQ3qAHz_ABNoNZpOiUIupURQCR6ydVReXD40/edit?usp=sharing) We request you to only present projects that are at an advanced stage. Although only a title and abstract are circulated to participants, sharing a copy of the working paper is encouraged. 

Note: The online seminar is not recorded, is invite-only and not open to the public.
