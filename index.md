## Seminar in Applied Microeconomics - Virtual Assembly and Discussion 

SAMVAAD is a platform for faculty and researchers in India to present their work and get feedback from the applied micro community. The online seminars will be conducted on Zoom every Friday from 10 AM to 11:15 AM IST. 

- _Format:_ Speakers will have 45 mins to present their research, followed by 30 mins of questions and answers, in the spirit of having an open dialogue and discussion. 
  - While the speaker is presenting, only clarifying questions may be asked in the chat window. Co-authors should feel free to answer questions in the chat and if a question is unanswered (or if there is no co-author), the moderator will interject the presenter to ask the question. 
  - After the presentation is over, the floor will be open for the audience. Participants are requested to use the ‘raise hand’ feature on Zoom to queue up for comments.

- _Registration:_ Attendance is capped at 300 so please only [sign up](https://forms.gle/JsXhRoNskxuKQuk59) only if you can attend regularly. Space constraints imply that preference will be given to faculty over graduate students.

- _Invites:_ The link to the webinar will be shared with registered participants 2 hours before the talk. To prevent ‘zoombombing’, please do not share the invitation link or post it online. (However, please feel free to share the link to the [sign up page](https://forms.gle/JsXhRoNskxuKQuk59))

- _Scheduling:_ If you would like to present your research, please email [Sabyasachi Das](mailto:sabya.economist@gmail.com) or [Aaditya Dar](mailto:aadityadar@gmail.com). We request you to only present projects that are at an advanced stage; sharing a copy of the working paper is highly encouraged. 

- _Housekeeping:_ The webinar is not recorded and regrettably not open to the public either. We also request participants to not share findings of the paper without the explicit permission of the speaker. Finally, please keep your mic on mute when you join the Zoom meeting.
